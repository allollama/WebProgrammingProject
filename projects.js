Computer engineering students designed this tool to be implemented for a social enterprise called 'iMerit' that generates new economy livelihoods in India (CEO of iMerit is Radha Basu, Director of the Frugal Innovation Lab). Considers the fact that feature phones are common, schools have outdated books, and women want and need jobs. iMerit works with employees and publishers, who then utilize MUVE to digitize relevant content. With the aim of providing a better education and enabling more jobs to be generated, MUVE is currently being deployed by a team of SCU students in rural centers in India."
